# Library_Management_System-_using-_SQL
SQL Project
## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It covers the creation and management of relational tables, execution of full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and the use of advanced SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis. The objective is to demonstrate strong skills in database design, data manipulation, and efficient querying.

## Objectives
Database Setup: Designed and populated a Library Management System database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issue records, and return records.
CRUD Operations: Implemented complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to efficiently manage library data.
CTAS (Create Table As Select): Used CTAS to generate new tables directly from query results for reporting and analysis purposes.
Advanced SQL Queries: Developed complex SQL queries to retrieve insights, perform data analysis, and support library operations.
